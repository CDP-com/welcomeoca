    <strong>One Solution to Solve Your Technology Problems</strong>
			<p>SnapBack is a growing collection of Apps designed to solve your technology problems quickly, easily and safely.  
			Our Development Community is actively creating solutions available for you today and in the future.  If you would
			like, you can even help the community find and solve new problems.</p>

 <strong>SnapBack Apps Vision</strong>
<p>SnapBack Apps provides the ability to adjust the way your computer works by designing precisely what users want. 
Instead of relying on what just a small group of great designers had in mind, users get to easily make changes if the 
designs are slightly "off the mark". With SnapBack Apps, you can click on any one button and change literally anything you can think 
of: the way any application works, the way Windows or your computer looks or acts... Anything!</p>

 

<strong>SnapBack Apps on my Device</strong>
<p>At the heart of the SnapBack Apps project is the SnapBack Apps Platform. Currently limited to only Windows operating systems, this platform
 houses all of our apps. Unlike other application based programs, SnapBack Apps is unique in that you get ALL of our apps rather than having 
 to individually select ones. This allows users the ability to use any given app at any time, particularly in those moments when an app is 
 absolutely necessary.</p>

 <p>The platform and the apps themselves are designed to be updated automatically so that you always have the most recent version. 
 Additionally, you are free to use the apps whether your online or not, giving you the flexibility to control your machine at any given moment.</p>

 

<strong>SnapBack Apps on the Web</strong>

<p>To help facilitate the best apps possible, the SnapBack Apps Factory was created. This online environment 
is used to help users of all skill and practice levels connect with highly experienced developers so that new apps can be
 created and existing ones improved upon. The principle aim of this environment is to engage users and developers with one 
 another, so that developers have direct feedback to their products and users have the means to provide direct feedback 
 (including suggestions as to how to improve a product).</p>

 
<p>Cooperation and engagement are the backbones of the SnapBack Apps Factory. Members of the factory or even visitors  productively work 
together to assign and accomplish tasks. Additionally, the factory is unique in that anyone (including non logged-in users) can contribute 
by creating pages and modifying existing content.</p>

                      
			<strong>Select an app to run from the navigation outline under Featured Apps.</strong><br />
			<br />&nbsp;<br />

			<li>The My-Only-Menu system makes it quick and easy to find and run ALL your apps.
			<li>The Community ensures that SnapBack will never install unwanted or unexpected software.

Take a look <a id="proofs" href="http://factory.snapback-apps.com/new-app-proofs/">HERE</a>, and give us some comments about the INDIVIDUAL features, not just the overall, up, down, or ranking vote, since we will use a composite of everyone's views.</p>

	<p><strong>No Cost to You.</strong></p>
	
	<p>All SnapBack Apps are free for both business and personal use, provided that the SnapBack Platform is "hand installed", by a user and not "mass installed".    However, for some apps they may be working with or modify another application, such as Microsoft Word, which is obviously not free.  Sometimes we might independently offer that application to you with a link to a separate page.  If and when we offer you the software, we warrant that to our best ability, we've fully disclosed which products in that category are best, the least cost prices with links, along with any dissenting opinions from contributors like you. </p>
	
	<p>For all our users, contributors, attributable sources, and other companies, we've prepared an easy to understand page that explains all our <a id="policiesterms" href="#" >Policies, Complete Terms, and Conditions of our SnapBack Apps, Platform, website, and our SnapBack Apps Factory</a> where they are produced.  Together, this page, the FAQ, and the discussions of users, contributors, and CDP should convince you that this project is worthy of your full support.</p>
