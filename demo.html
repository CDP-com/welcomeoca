					<strong><p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to SnapBack Apps!</p></strong>

               <p>SnapBack Apps is a single huge application that is designed to give users the ability to easily, safely, quickly, understandably, and reversibly “regain control of your computer experience”.  It does this by giving you the ability to add, change and control the way any software application, operating system, hardware, or cloud application looks and functions. </p>
               
               <p>Select the app you would like to run from the selection offered under Featured Apps.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="tab2">
               <p>The Mission of SnapBack Apps is to return the power over technology back to the user. The chief aim is to “end technology frustration” by allowing regular users the ability to suggest and even develop solutions to their common technology problems.</p>
               
               <p>CDP’s SnapBack Apps project will pioneer the way users interact and modify their technology. SnapBack Apps will resolve many of the issues that arise when a user wants to change something very specific with their computer or phone. SnapBack Apps will categorize and organize all of its applications, so that a user can simply search for a specific modification. </p>
               <p>Context will be provided for each app, giving the user a wide variety of information regarding the application’s functionality.  If users find the app’s documentation to be insufficient or incorrect, they will have the ability to edit the pertinent pages, or make comments with suggested edits.</p>
               
               <p>Lastly, SnapBack apps will truly be “one-click” in that a user simply has to click a button for an application to take effect with no interactive installation process or preferences to set. If an application doesn’t work the way a user intends, they will have the ability to directly comment and suggest improvements so that every application, no matter its purpose, can be perfected.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="tab3">
               <p>A SnapBack App is a browser based application that simplifies tasks on your computer. A task could require the user to follow a list of written instructions to accomplish. Many times these instructions are not easy to follow or may vary depending on manufacturer, operating system, and other computer environment variables. Our Apps are provided on a secure website and are safely delivered and executed.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="tab4">
               <p>CDP certifies and warrants that each SnapBack App is safe and effective or it cannot be run from the web.  Our SnapBack Apps community ensures that each SnapBack App that CDP certifies really does satisfy exactly what users want without spamming or taking advantage of users. </p>
               <strong>Signed Executables, Etc.</strong>
               <p>Signing code is a method of ensuring that the code has come from a valid software publisher and has not been altered by anyone.</p>
               <strong>Manifest of Files with Hash Checking</strong>
               
               <p>The manifest containing the files for the package have as an attribute for each file the hashing algorithm used to check it and the hash value when the file was packaged. This allows us to re-validate the file is the one packaged and has not been tampered with.</p>
               <strong>Signed Manifests</strong>
               
               <p>The manifest for each package is signed to make sure it is not tampered with. The SnapBack Engine validates the signature on each manifest before processing it. Before reading a manifest file the signature is always validated, for updates or running commands.</p>
               <strong>Windows Integrity Control Enforced</strong>
               
               <p>The SnapBack Engine enforces Window Integrity policies. . . .</p>
